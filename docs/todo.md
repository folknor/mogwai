# TODO

Open work only. How the built system works lives in
`reference/architecture.md`; the landing-by-landing history is in git; the
per-crate mechanics are in code comments.

Once an item here is completed, it GETS REMOVED ENTIRELY. If the prose contains
any relevant information that must endure, it gets either (a) added as an inline
comment in the code, or (b) added to an existing or new ../reference/ document.

Or both. There are no exceptions.

## Open issues

- The accelerated smoke (a coherent-clock-spec gate, not a forward-origin gate)
  times out on its market-data subscribe.

## Notes / gotchas

- The offline Kraken corpus is trades only - no quotes, no L2, no aggressor side.
  This shapes the offline analysis only; the running server synthesizes trades
  with a native `Buyer`/`Seller` aggressor and serves no quotes (`/quotes` is
  always empty). `KrakenCsvSource` and `TickRuleAggressor` survive in
  `mogwai-data` for the offline lineage and its unit tests.
- `MOGWAI_DATA_DIR` (default `/media/folk/Banan/Kraken_Trading_History`) is an
  offline-analysis input only (`analysis/`), never a server runtime knob.
- `research/` (the nautilus and broadarrow clones) is gitignored; read those APIs
  from there, depend on the sibling `../` checkouts.
